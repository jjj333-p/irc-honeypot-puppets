### IRC Honeypot

Literally just joins a bunch of accounts to an irc channel to make it populated for use as a honeypot. Puppets will ping back when pinged by another user, so they dont seem dead. 

To use run `npm install`, copy `example-config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and follow instructions inside, then run node `index.js` to start.
